    "## Addition of a Video to GlobeStream\n",
    "\n",
    "When adding a video, the user fills a certain part of the new record ('title', 'category', 'duration') while the rest is automatically created in the background. The 'publish' date attribute is the current datetime, 'days_online' and 'viewed' are of course starting at 0 (refreshed when running the 'refresh_videos_job'). The unique identifier is made equal to the starting nb. of rows of the 'videos' file: since as I noticed each addition of a record creates also an empty line, 'id' attributed in this way will be equal to the previous one plus 2. It actually doesn't really matter if the 'id' entries are not spaced one by one, as long as they are unique. For this project I imagine no video can be removed therefore there is no risk that removing a record and setting id for a new one based on the new reduced length will conflict with a pre-existing record."
